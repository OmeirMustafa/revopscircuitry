# RevOpsCircuitry | Revenue Systems Architecture

The official digital platform for **RevOpsCircuitry**, a high-performance consultancy engineering revenue engines for B2B SaaS and Industrial firms.

## ⚡ Tech Stack (The Architecture)
This platform is built as a high-performance web application, not a standard website.
- **Core:** React 18 + Vite (High-velocity rendering)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v3 (Utility-first design system)
- **Animation:** Framer Motion (System visualization)
- **Deployment:** Vercel (Edge network distribution)

## 🚀 Engineering Philosophy
We treat revenue operations as a circuit. This codebase reflects that philosophy:
- **Componentized:** Modular "products" (Build, Retainer, Lead Gen).
- **Type-Safe:** predictable data flow.
- **Performance:** Sub-100ms load times for instant authority.
